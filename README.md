# BunnyGame
The BunnyGame gives you the opportunity to draw cards that either allow your bunny to advance one, two, or three spaces, or tell you to rotate the carrot.

The probability of drawing a card with a 1 is 0.375, for a 2 it's 0.25, and for a 3 it's 0.125. The carrot also appears with a probability of 0.25.
This makes the BunnyGame compatible with Lotti Karotti.
